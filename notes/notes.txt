# Project name

MstHora (Meister Hora, Secundus Minutius Hora)

Digital clock - based on Raspberry Pi-Pico - can be synchronized wirelessly - time recording even when the device is switched off - adjustment of the display intensity to the environment

# How to build:

This is a test project for pico using cmake.

1. Copy both folders test1_src and test1_build to linux virtual machine:

    ```
    <path>--+
            +-[test1_build]
            |
            +-[test1_src]
    ```

2. Goto test1_build folder:

    $ cd <path>/test1_build
    
3. Export the path where [pico-sdk] folder is located.

    By example, if pico-sdk is located here: /home/igor/pico/pico-sdk
   
    $ export PICO_SDK_PATH=/home/igor/pico/pico-sdk
   
4. Configure the project cmake:

    $ cmake ../test1_src
    
5. Build the project:

    $ make -j4

# Logging / Debugging

Use CLI

# Measurements

Current at minimal intensity: 27mA = 135mW @ 5V

Current at maximal intensity: 45mA = 225mW @ 5V
